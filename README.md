## Object Movement Tracking with OpenCv (https://arjunkumbakkara.github.io)
This will help in tracking the object movement . We set a color that it traces all through and tracks and marks it.

### Prerequisites
Python ([version 2.7] (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) or above). 
You need to install opencv library . head to (https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/)
For installation instructions (https://docs.opencv.org/master/d3/d52/tutorial_windows_install.html#tutorial_windows_install_path)

### How it works:
This object tracking is done by analyzing the sequential video frames then plots the movement of the target between the frames. Algorithm to do this should be chosen by careful weighing of pros and cons.
The visual tracking system can majorly be broken into 
1.Target representation and localization 
2.Filtering 
3.Data association.

### Use Cases:
1.Human-computer interaction in all forms.
2.Security and surveillance cameras.
3.Video communication and compression .
4.Augmented reality
5.Traffic control Applicatiosn.
6.Medical imaging 
7.Video editing.
